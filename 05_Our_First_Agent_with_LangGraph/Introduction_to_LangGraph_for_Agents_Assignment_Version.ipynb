        "\n",
        "Due to the inclusion of cycles over loops, we can also compose rather complex flows through our graph in a much more readable and natural fashion. Effectively allowing us to recreate application flowcharts in code in an almost 1-to-1 fashion.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Why LangGraph?\n",
        "\n",
        "Beyond the agent-forward approach - we can easily compose and combine traditional \"DAG\" (directed acyclic graph) chains with powerful cyclic behaviour due to the tight integration with LCEL. This means it's a natural extension to LangChain's core offerings!"

        "The LangGraph recursion limit sets the maximum number of super-steps (a single iteration over the graph nodes) the graph can execute during a single execution. Once the limit is reached, LangGraph will raise `GraphRecursionError`. By default this value is set to **25 steps**. The recursion limit can be set on any graph at runtime, and is passed to .invoke/.stream via the `config` dictionary.\n",

        "\n",
        "To return state before hitting the limit, we can modify the code:\n",
        "1. Add a `cycle_count` field to the `AgentState` to keep track of the number of cycles.\n",

        "        cycle_count: int  # Add a counter to track the number of cycles\n",
        "```\n",
        "2. Increment the `cycle_count` in the `call_model` function.\n",

        "```\n",
        "3. Modify the `should_continue` function to check if the `cycle_count` has reached a predefined limit (e.g., 10 cycles). If it has, it returns END.\n",

QLoRA backpropagates gradients through\\na frozen, 4-bit quantized pretrained language model into Low Rank\\nAdapters~(LoRA). Our best model family, which we name Guanaco, outperforms all\\nprevious openly released models on the Vicuna benchmark, reaching 99.3% of the\\nperformance level of ChatGPT while only requiring 24 hours of finetuning on a\\nsingle GPU. QLoRA introduces a number of innovations to save memory without\\nsacrificing performance: (a) 4-bit NormalFloat (NF4), a new data type that is\\ninformation theoretically optimal for normally distributed weights (b) double\\nquantization to reduce the average memory footprint by quantizing the\\nquantization constants, and (c) paged optimziers to manage memory spikes. We\\nuse QLoRA to finetune more than 1,000 models, providing a detailed analysis of\\ninstruction following and chatbot performance across 8 instruction datasets,\\nmultiple model types (LLaMA, T5), and model scales that would be infeasible to\\nrun with regular finetuning (e.g. 33B and 65B parameter models). Our results\\nshow that QLoRA finetuning on a small high-quality dataset leads to\\nstate-of-the-art results, even when using smaller models than the previous\\nSoTA. We provide a detailed analysis of chatbot performance based on both human\\nand GPT-4 evaluations showing that GPT-4 evaluations are a cheap and reasonable\\nalternative to human evaluation. Furthermore, we find that current chatbot\\nbenchmarks are not trustworthy to accurately evaluate the performance levels of\\nchatbots. A lemon-picked analysis demonstrates where Guanaco fails compared to\\nChatGPT. We release all of our models and code, including CUDA kernels for\\n4-bit training.\\n\\nPublished: 2024-05-27\\nTitle: Accurate LoRA-Finetuning Quantization of LLMs via Information Retention\\nAuthors: Haotong Qin, Xudong Ma, Xingyu Zheng, Xiaoyang Li, Yang Zhang, Shouda Liu, Jie Luo, Xianglong Liu, Michele Magno\\nSummary: The LoRA-finetuning quantization of LLMs has been extensively studied to\\nobtain accurate yet compact LLMs for deployment on resource-constrained\\nhardware. However, existing methods cause the quantized LLM to severely degrade\\nand even fail to benefit from the finetuning of LoRA. This paper proposes a\\nnovel IR-QLoRA for pushing quantized LLMs with LoRA to be highly accurate\\nthrough information retention. The proposed IR-QLoRA mainly relies on two\\ntechnologies derived from the perspective of unified information: (1)\\nstatistics-based Information Calibration Quantization allows the quantized\\nparameters of LLM to retain original information accurately; (2)\\nfinetuning-based Information Elastic Connection makes LoRA utilizes elastic\\nrepresentation transformation with diverse information. Comprehensive\\nexperiments show that IR-QLoRA can significantly improve accuracy across LLaMA\\nand LLaMA2 families under 2-4 bit-widths, e.g., 4- bit LLaMA-7B achieves 1.4%\\nimprovement on MMLU compared with the state-of-the-art methods. The significant\\nperformance gain requires only a tiny 0.31% additional time consumption,\\nrevealing the satisfactory efficiency of our IR-QLoRA. We highlight that\\nIR-QLoRA enjoys excellent versatility, compatible with various frameworks\\n(e.g., NormalFloat and Integer quantization) and brings general accuracy gains.\\nThe code is available at https://github.com/htqin/ir-qlora.\\n\\nPublished: 2024-06-12\\nTitle: Exploring Fact Memorization and Style Imitation in LLMs Using QLoRA: An Experimental Study and Quality Assessment Methods\\nAuthors: Eugene Vyborov, Oleksiy Osypenko, Serge Sotnyk\\nSummary: There are various methods for adapting LLMs to different domains. The most\\ncommon methods are prompting, finetuning, and RAG. In this w', name='arxiv', id='2750b618-8547-4b29-a326-915d6e28e581', tool_call_id='call_tSVFo8QjW7jd2PGECq8scUji')]\n",

              "\"RAG stands for Retrieval-Augmented Generation. It is a technique used in natural language processing (NLP) that combines retrieval-based methods with generative models to improve the quality and relevance of generated text. Here's a brief overview of how it works:\\n\\n1. **Retrieval**: In the first step, the system retrieves relevant documents or pieces of information from a large corpus or database. This is typically done using a retrieval model that ranks documents based on their relevance to the input query or context.\\n\\n2. **Augmentation**: The retrieved documents are then used to augment the input to a generative model. This means that the generative model has access to additional context or information that can help it produce more accurate and contextually appropriate responses.\\n\\n3. **Generation**: Finally, a generative model, such as a transformer-based language model, uses the augmented input to generate a response or piece of text. The presence of relevant information from the retrieval step helps the model generate more informed and precise outputs.\\n\\nRAG is particularly useful in scenarios where the model needs to generate responses based on a large and potentially dynamic set of information, such as in open-domain question answering or conversational AI systems. By leveraging both retrieval and generation, RAG can produce more accurate and contextually relevant responses than using a generative model alone.\""

It involves adding low-rank matrices to the frozen original model, which significantly reduces the number of trainable parameters and the GPU memory requirement. This method allows for efficient fine-tuning of large models, making them more adaptable to new contexts while maintaining performance. LoRA is particularly useful in scenarios where computational resources are limited, as it enables the fine-tuning of large models with fewer resources. [Learn more about LoRA](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ai/what-is-lora/).\\n\\n### Tim Dettmers\\nTim Dettmers is a research scientist at the Allen Institute for AI and an incoming assistant professor at Carnegie Mellon University. His work focuses on efficient deep learning methods, including quantization, sparsity, and low-bit inference. Dettmers is known for his research on making large AI models, like ChatGPT, more accessible by reducing their resource requirements. He has contributed to methods that allow AI models to be adapted for specialized domains with reduced computational costs. [More about Tim Dettmers](https://timdettmers.com/about/).\\n\\n### Attention in Machine Learning\\nAttention mechanisms in machine learning are inspired by the human cognitive process of selective focus. They allow neural networks to dynamically highlight and use the most relevant parts of the input data, improving the model's ability to handle complex tasks such as language translation and image recognition. Attention mechanisms are a key component in many deep learning models, enabling them to capture long-term dependencies and integrate different parts of the input data effectively.

            "**Definition:**\n",
            "Prompt engineering is the process of designing inputs for generative artificial intelligence (AI) models to deliver useful, accurate, and relevant responses. It is primarily used with large language models (LLMs) like OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's Gemini. The goal is to optimize the output from these models by crafting well-engineered prompts, which can lead to improved results and efficiency. This involves creating prompts that guide AI models in generating accurate and relevant responses, often used in customer support, content generation, and data analysis. Techniques in prompt engineering include few-shot learning, chain-of-thought reasoning, and iterative refinement, among others.\n",
            "\n",
            "**History:**\n",
            "The history of prompt engineering is tied to the evolution of natural language processing (NLP) and AI. Initially, prompts were simple, but as LLMs like GPT-3 became more complex, prompt engineering evolved to match this complexity. Key developments include the introduction of attention mechanisms in 2015, which revolutionized prompt engineering by enhancing language models' contextual understanding. The rise of massive language models like GPT-3 in 2020-2021 transformed prompt engineering, allowing for greater adaptability and domain-specific tailoring. Advanced prompting techniques have continued to evolve, pushing language models beyond conventional tasks and enhancing their versatility and interactive capabilities.\n",

            "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technology that enhances generative models by integrating retrieval-based methods. This approach allows AI systems to provide more accurate and contextually relevant responses by retrieving pertinent information from knowledge bases or past interactions. RAG is particularly useful in generating well-researched articles, personalized learning content, and improving recommendation systems.\n",
            "\n",
            "The term \"RAG\" was coined in a 2020 paper by Patrick Lewis and co-authors from Facebook AI Research (now Meta AI), University College London, and New York University. The concept was inspired by earlier methods and a paper from Google researchers, aiming to create a system that could learn and generate any text output by incorporating a retrieval index.\n",

This allows the model to adapt to specific tasks or domains while leveraging the general knowledge it has already acquired during its initial training on a larger dataset. Fine-tuning is particularly useful because it can significantly reduce the amount of data and computational resources required to train a model for a specific task, as the model starts with a strong foundation of general knowledge.\n",
            "\n",
            "Fine-tuning became prominent with the rise of transfer learning techniques, especially in the field of natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision. In NLP, the introduction of models like BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) in 2018 popularized the concept of fine-tuning. BERT and similar models are pre-trained on large corpora of text and then fine-tuned on specific tasks such as sentiment analysis, question answering, or named entity recognition.\n",
