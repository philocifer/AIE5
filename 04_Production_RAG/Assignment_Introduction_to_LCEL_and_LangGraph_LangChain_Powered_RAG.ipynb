This includes conditionals and loops that can influence how data is processed or how interactions with the LLM are structured.\\n\\n3. **Integration with LLMs**: LECL is designed to work seamlessly with LLMs, allowing users to construct prompts dynamically based on variable values or other inputs in the application.\\n\\n4. **Ease of Use**: With a focus on simplicity and usability, LECL aims to provide a more intuitive way for developers to interact with and manipulate language models, without needing to dive deeply into the underlying implementation details.\\n\\nOverall, LECL enhances the capabilities of LangChain by providing a structured way to work with expressions, enabling developers to streamline their workflows and build more powerful LLM-driven applications.' additional_kwargs={'refusal': None} response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 302, 'prompt_tokens': 27, 'total_tokens': 329, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'cached_tokens': 0}}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_8221799169', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None} id='run-67da58d6-0759-4226-8774-adb996d910ff-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 27, 'output_tokens': 302, 'total_tokens': 329, 'input_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'cache_read': 0}, 'output_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'reasoning': 0}}\n"

        "\n",
        "# Understanding LangChain Runnables and LCEL\n",
        "\n",
        "In LangChain, a Runnable is like a LEGO brick in your AI application - it's a standardized component that can be easily connected with other components. The real power of Runnables comes from their ability to be combined in flexible ways using LCEL (LangChain Expression Language).\n",
        "\n",
        "## Key Features of Runnables\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. Universal Interface\n",
        "Every Runnable in LangChain follows the same pattern:\n",
        "- Takes an input\n",
        "- Performs some operation\n",
        "- Returns an output\n",
        "\n",
        "This consistency means you can treat different components (like models, retrievers, or parsers) in the same way.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. Built-in Parallelization\n",
        "Runnables come with methods for handling multiple inputs efficiently:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "# Process inputs in parallel, maintain order\n",
        "results = chain.batch([input1, input2, input3])\n",
        "\n",
        "# Process inputs as they complete\n",
        "for result in chain.batch_as_completed([input1, input2, input3]):\n",
        "    print(result)\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. Streaming Support\n",
        "Perfect for responsive applications:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "# Stream outputs as they're generated\n",
        "for chunk in chain.stream({\"query\": \"Tell me a story\"}):\n",
        "    print(chunk, end=\"\", flush=True)\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4. Easy Composition\n",
        "The `|` operator makes building pipelines intuitive:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "# Create a basic RAG chain\n",
        "rag_chain = retriever | prompt | model | output_parser\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "## Common Types of Runnables\n",

Since our system will be constructed of many parts moving in a coordinated fashion - we want to be able to ensure we have some commonly understood idea of that state.\n",

        "Let's think about a simple example to help understand exactly what this means (we'll simplify a great deal to try and clearly communicate what state is doing):\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **We initialize our state object**:\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   {\n",
        "       \"question\": \"\",\n",
        "       \"context\": [],\n",

        "\n",

        "   We store the user's question in `state[\"question\"]`. Now we have:\n",
        "   ```python\n",

        "       \"question\": \"How tall is the Eiffel Tower?\",\n",
        "       \"context\": [],\n",
        "       \"response\": \"\"\n",
        "   }\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **We pass our state object to an Agent node** which is able to read the current state. It will use the value of `state[\"question\"]` as input and might retrieve some context documents related to the question. It then generates a response which it stores in `state[\"response\"]`. For example:\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   {\n",
        "       \"question\": \"How tall is the Eiffel Tower?\",\n",

        "   }\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "That's it! The important part is that we have a consistent object (`State`) that's passed around, holding the crucial information as we go from one node to the next. This ensures our application has a single source of truth about what has happened so far and what is happening now.\n",

              "'LangChain Expression Language (LCEL) works by allowing users to declaratively compose chains together. This approach has several benefits, including:\\n\\n1. **Async, Batch, and Streaming Support**: Chains constructed using LCEL automatically support synchronous, asynchronous, batch, and streaming operations. This flexibility makes it easy to prototype chains in environments like Jupyter notebooks with a synchronous interface and then expose them as asynchronous streaming interfaces.\\n\\n2. **Fallbacks**: Given the non-determinism of large language models (LLMs), LCEL provides the ability to handle errors gracefully by attaching fallbacks to any chain.\\n\\n3. **Parallelism**: LCEL takes advantage of parallelism in LLM applications, particularly important when dealing with potentially lengthy API calls. Any components that can be executed in parallel do so automatically within the LCEL syntax.\\n\\nOverall, LCEL facilitates the development of robust and efficient applications that leverage LLMs while managing complexity and performance.'"

It supports asynchronous, batch, and streaming operations, allowing for easy prototyping in synchronous environments, such as Jupyter notebooks, while also enabling asynchronous streaming interfaces. Additionally, LCEL provides features such as fallbacks to handle errors gracefully due to the non-determinism of large language models (LLMs) and supports parallel execution of components that can be run concurrently, which is beneficial for handling long API calls in LLM applications.\n",

            "1. **Declarative Framework**: The context states that \"LangChain Expression Language or LCEL is a declarative way to easily compose chains together,\" which aligns with the statement that it is a \"declarative framework designed to compose chains of operations easily.\"\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Support for Asynchronous, Batch, and Streaming Operations**: The context mentions \"Async, Batch, and Streaming Support\" and explains that chains constructed with LCEL will automatically support these features. This is reflected in the statement.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Prototyping in Synchronous Environments**: The context indicates that prototyping is easy in a Jupyter notebook using the sync interface, affirming the claim in the statement about easy prototyping in synchronous environments.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Asynchronous Streaming Interfaces**: The context implies that after prototyping, the same chain can be exposed as an async streaming interface, which is successfully captured in the statement.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Fallbacks for Error Handling**: The context mentions that LCEL allows attaching fallbacks to handle the non-determinism of LLMs, matching the statement regarding error handling capabilities.\n",
            "\n",
            "6. **Support for Parallel Execution**: The context states that components that can run in parallel will do so automatically with LCEL, which is again aligned with the statement about parallel execution supporting long API calls.\n",
            "\n",
            "Since all parts of the statement are supported by the context, no corrections are needed. Therefore, the final verdict is:\n",
