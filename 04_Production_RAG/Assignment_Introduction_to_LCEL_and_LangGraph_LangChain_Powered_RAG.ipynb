Peer into the wisdom of others’ critiques and let your errors melt away like a fondue pot over an eager flame.\\n\\n5. **Mix the Flavors – Try New Libraries**: Explore the wide world beyond the basic cheddar! Sample the tangy bite of NumPy for numerical sorcery, the creamy texture of Pandas for delightful dataframes, or the rich aroma of Flask for web-weaving spells.

        "# Understanding LangChain Runnables and LCEL\n",
        "\n",
        "In LangChain, a Runnable is like a LEGO brick in your AI application - it's a standardized component that can be easily connected with other components. The real power of Runnables comes from their ability to be combined in flexible ways using LCEL (LangChain Expression Language).\n",
        "\n",
        "## Key Features of Runnables\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. Universal Interface\n",
        "Every Runnable in LangChain follows the same pattern:\n",
        "- Takes an input\n",
        "- Performs some operation\n",
        "- Returns an output\n",
        "\n",
        "This consistency means you can treat different components (like models, retrievers, or parsers) in the same way.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. Built-in Parallelization\n",
        "Runnables come with methods for handling multiple inputs efficiently:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "# Process inputs in parallel, maintain order\n",
        "results = chain.batch([input1, input2, input3])\n",
        "\n",
        "# Process inputs as they complete\n",
        "for result in chain.batch_as_completed([input1, input2, input3]):\n",
        "    print(result)\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. Streaming Support\n",
        "Perfect for responsive applications:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "# Stream outputs as they're generated\n",
        "for chunk in chain.stream({\"query\": \"Tell me a story\"}):\n",
        "    print(chunk, end=\"\", flush=True)\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4. Easy Composition\n",
        "The `|` operator makes building pipelines intuitive:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "# Create a basic RAG chain\n",
        "rag_chain = retriever | prompt | model | output_parser\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "## Common Types of Runnables\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Language Models**: Like our `ChatOpenAI` instance\n",

Since our system will be constructed of many parts moving in a coordinated fashion - we want to be able to ensure we have some commonly understood idea of that state.\n",

        "Let's think about a simple example to help understand exactly what this means (we'll simplify a great deal to try and clearly communicate what state is doing):\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **We initialize our state object**:\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   {\n",
        "       \"question\": \"\",\n",
        "       \"context\": [],\n",

        "   We store the user's question in `state[\"question\"]`. Now we have:\n",
        "   ```python\n",

        "   }\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **We pass our state object to an Agent node** which is able to read the current state. It will use the value of `state[\"question\"]` as input and might retrieve some context documents related to the question. It then generates a response which it stores in `state[\"response\"]`. For example:\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   {\n",
        "       \"question\": \"How tall is the Eiffel Tower?\",\n",

        "   ```\n",
        "\n",

Additionally, LCEL allows for handling fallbacks and managing errors gracefully due to the non-determinism of language models. It also enables parallel execution of components that can be run concurrently, which is beneficial given the often lengthy API calls in LLM applications.'"

            "LCEL, or LangChain Expression Language, is a declarative way to compose chains together. It provides several benefits, including:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **Async, Batch, and Streaming Support**: Any chain constructed with LCEL will automatically support synchronous, asynchronous, batch, and streaming interfaces. This allows for easy prototyping in environments like a Jupyter notebook and later exposing the prototype as an async streaming interface.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Handling Fallbacks**: The non-determinism of large language models (LLMs) necessitates handling errors gracefully. LCEL allows users to easily attach fallbacks to any chain.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Parallelism**: Since LLM applications often involve lengthy API calls, LCEL's syntax enables components that can run in parallel to do so automatically, enhancing efficiency in processing.\n",
