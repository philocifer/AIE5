        "1. **Adjust Temperature and Top-P**: These parameters control the randomness of the model's outputs. Lower temperatures (closer to 0) make the output more deterministic, while higher temperatures (closer to 1) make it more random. Similarly, setting Top-P to lower values (closer to 0) reduces the model's creative liberties and makes outputs more consistent.\n",
        "2. **Optimize Model Output Accuracy**: Accurate responses require that the model has all the information it needs to generate a response, and knows how to go about creating a response (from interpreting input to formatting and styling). Often, this will require a mix of prompt engineering, RAG, and model fine-tuning."
