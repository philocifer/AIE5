        "#### ✅ Answer:\n",
        "\n",
        "**Limitations**\n",
        "1. **Storage Overhead**: Caching both text inputs and their vector embeddings requires substantial storage space, especially for large document collections.\n",
        "2. **Locality Constraints**: The cache is restricted to the local machine and isn't accessible in distributed environments.\n",
        "3. **Cache Invalidation Challenges**: When the underlying embedding model is updated or changed, all cached embeddings become invalid and need to be regenerated from scratch.\n",
        "4. **Namespace Management**: The implementation uses a simple MD5 hash of the model URL as the namespace, which might not account for all model parameters that affect embedding output.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Most Useful Scenarios**\n",
        "1. **Repeated Document Processing**: When you're analyzing the same documents multiple times, either during development or in production applications where content is relatively static.\n",
        "2. **Cost Optimization**: For applications using paid embedding APIs (like OpenAI), caching dramatically reduces the number of API calls, resulting in substantial cost savings.\n",
        "3. **Development and Testing**: During the development cycle when you're iterating on the same dataset repeatedly, the cache prevents unnecessary recomputation of embeddings.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Least Useful Scenarios**\n",
        "1. **Highly Dynamic Content**: Applications where document content changes frequently, making cached embeddings quickly outdated.\n",
        "2. **Memory-Constrained Environments**: The cache can grow large with extensive document collections, potentially causing memory issues in constrained environments.\n",
        "3. **Model Experimentation**: When frequently changing embedding models, the cache becomes less useful as embeddings from different models aren't compatible."

        "#### ✅ Answer:\n",
        "**Limitations**\n",
        "1. **Memory constraints**: The in-memory cache size is limited by available RAM, potentially causing memory pressure during long-running sessions with no built-in mechanism to limit cache size or evict entries when memory gets full.\n",
        "2. **No persistence**: All cached data is lost when the application restarts or crashes, making it impossible to share cache between different application instances or processes.\n",
        "3. **Limited cache control**: The implementation offers minimal configuration options with no time-to-live (TTL) settings for cache entries or sophisticated eviction policies.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Most Useful Scenarios**\n",
        "1. **Development and Prototyping**: Perfect for quick iteration during development. Simple to implement and test.\n",
        "2. **Applications with Repetitive Queries**: Testing environments where the same prompts are used repeatedly. Demos where you want consistent, fast responses.\n",
        "3. **Performance-Critical Local Applications**: In-memory caching provides the fastest possible access times. Useful when response time is critical and the dataset is manageable.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Least Useful Scenarios**\n",
        "1. **Production Systems**: Services that can't afford to lose cache on restart. Applications that need to scale horizontally.\n",
        "2. **Applications with High Memory Constraints**: Resource-constrained environments like edge devices or shared hosting.\n",
        "3. **Systems with Highly Variable Queries**: Applications where each request is unique (low cache hit rates). Personalized content where caching benefits are minimal."
